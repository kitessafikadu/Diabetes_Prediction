# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes based on various health parameters. The model is built using a dataset that includes factors like age, gender, BMI, blood glucose levels, and more. The goal of the project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a person based on these factors.

## Project Overview

The notebook uses machine learning techniques to build and train a classification model that can predict whether a person has diabetes. It also includes preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

### Features
- **Input Features:**
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Hypertension
  - Heart Disease
  - Smoking History
  - BMI (Body Mass Index)
  - HbA1c Level (Average Blood Glucose Over 2-3 Months)
  - Blood Glucose Level

- **Output:**
  - Diabetes prediction: 1 (Positive) or 0 (Negative)

## Requirements

To run the diabetes prediction notebook, you'll need to install the following libraries:

- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - For data visualization
- `scikit-learn` - For machine learning model implementation
